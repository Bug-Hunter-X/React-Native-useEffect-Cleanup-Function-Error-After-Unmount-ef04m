This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error. This can happen if the cleanup function attempts to access a component's state or props after the component has unmounted.  The error might not be immediately obvious, as it's often swallowed by the React Native runtime. It typically manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes, especially when navigating between screens rapidly or during component re-renders.  The key is that the error occurs *after* the component is unmounted, making debugging more challenging.
